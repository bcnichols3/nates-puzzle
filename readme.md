# Nate's Puzzle

## Step 1 — Begin

First look at [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) and do the beginners courses on HTML, JavaScript and CSS. That'll give you the foundation you need.

## Step 2 — Begin Again

Your project here is to make a basic puzzle game, anything you like -- but keep it super simple. I suggest you do a slide puzzle. And built it entirely by yourself.

## Step 2a — Stuck?

If you're stuck on a problem, Google it! Protip: [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is the place every coder goes when they're stumped, because every coder gets stumped a dozen times a day.

Also bookmark the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) to look up how to do something you forget how to do. There's too much to coding to outright memorize. Reading documentation is core to being a programmer.
